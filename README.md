# Carte June

A webb app where users can register and view their current vaccinations. An alternative to the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, or the Carte June.

### TODO

- Setup a MySQL database
- Create a Django model for all the vaccinations
- Link bootstrap to the project
- Some sort of front end where users sign up, 2FA?
- Functionality so that users can download ther vacciantions data to an excel sheet
